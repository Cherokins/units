        <section id="roles">
            <h2>4.0 Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
            
            <h3>4.1 The Principal</h3>
            <p>Has overall responsibility for the integrity of the assessment process within the Institute. Ensures adequate resources are allocated for effective implementation of assessment policies. The Principal will establish an Assessment Committee to oversee the implementation of this policy and review assessment practices annually.</p>
            
            <h3>4.2 The Assessment Coordinator</h3>
            <p>Liaises with external bodies (e.g., CDACC) on assessment matters, registration, and scheduling. Manages the internal assessment and verification cycle and secures all assessment materials and trainee POEs. Maintains records of all assessment activities and provides regular reports to the Principal on assessment outcomes and compliance matters.</p>
            
            <h3>4.3 Trainers and or Verifiers/Assessors</h3>
            <p>Are TVETA licensed and responsible for conducting formative and summative internal assessments, guiding trainees in building their Portfolio of Evidence (POE), and providing timely feedback. They ensure assessment practices align with competency standards and maintain accurate records of trainee progress. Assessors must participate in regular standardization activities to ensure consistency in assessment decisions.</p>
            
            <h3>4.4 Internal Verifiers</h3>
            <p>Internal Verifiers are responsible for monitoring assessment practices to ensure they meet quality standards. They sample assessment decisions, provide feedback to assessors, and ensure consistency across assessment practices. Internal Verifiers must maintain detailed records of verification activities and report any concerns to the Assessment Coordinator.</p>
            
            <h3>4.5 Trainees</h3>
            <p>Are responsible for actively participating in assessments, diligently maintaining their POE, and adhering to all assessment rules. They must seek clarification when assessment requirements are unclear and submit all required evidence by specified deadlines. Trainees have the right to appeal assessment decisions through the formal appeals process.</p>
            
            <div class="note-box">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> For external examinations, trainers focus on formative assessment and preparation. For internal assessments, they are responsible for both formative and summative evaluation. All assessors must maintain current TVETA licensing and participate in regular professional development activities related to assessment practices.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="assessment-types">
            <h2>5.0 Types of Assessment</h2>
            <p>The Institute employs a blend of assessment methods to holistically evaluate trainee competence. The selection of assessment methods should be appropriate to the competency being assessed and may include one or more of the following:</p>
            <div class="assessment-types">
                <div class="type">
                    <h3>5.1 Portfolio of Evidence (POE) - Primary Assessment Tool</h3>
                    <p>A structured collection of evidence compiled by the trainee to demonstrate achievement of all competencies and learning outcomes. The POE provides a comprehensive record of the trainee's journey and achievements throughout their course of study.</p>
                    <p><strong>Contents include:</strong> Trainee details, assessment plan, direct observation sheets, photos of projects/artefacts, written reports, witness testimonies, and records of oral questioning. All evidence must be authenticated, valid, reliable, current, and sufficient to demonstrate competency.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="type">
                    <h3>5.2 Practical Tests / Projects</h3>
                    <p>Hands-on, timed assessments where trainees demonstrate specific practical skills under controlled conditions. Used to gather critical evidence for the POE. Practical assessments should be conducted in environments that simulate real workplace conditions as closely as possible.</p>
                    <p>Practical assessments must be conducted using equipment and materials that meet industry standards. Assessors must provide clear instructions and assessment criteria to trainees before the assessment begins.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="type">
                    <h3>5.3 Theory Tests</h3>
                    <p>Written or oral tests used to assess the underpinning knowledge and theory related to practical skills. These tests provide supporting knowledge evidence for the POE. Theory tests may include multiple-choice questions, short answer questions, essays, case studies, or oral questioning.</p>
                    <p>All theory tests must be reviewed by the Internal Verifier before use to ensure they are aligned with learning outcomes and free from cultural or gender bias. Model answers and marking schemes must be prepared for all theory assessments.</p>

            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="process">
            <h2>6.0 The Assessment Process</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formative Assessment (Continuous):</strong> Ongoing assessment throughout the training period. Trainers provide continuous feedback, guide POE development, and sign off on competencies as they are achieved. Formative assessment is primarily for learning development and identifying areas where additional support may be required.</li>
                <li><strong>Summative Assessment (Final):</strong> The final evaluation of the trainee's POE and any final practical/theory tests to make an overall judgement of competence for a unit/module. Summative assessment determines whether the trainee has met the required standards for certification.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Verification:</strong> A mandatory quality assurance step where a senior staff member samples assessed POEs to ensure assessors' decisions are consistent, fair, and accurate. Internal verification must cover at least 20% of assessments for each unit/module.</li>
                <li><strong>External Verification:</strong> External verifiers from relevant bodies (e.g., CDACC) visit the institution to verify the entire internal assessment and verification process. The Institute will fully cooperate with external verifiers and implement any recommendations for improvement.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>6.1 Assessment Planning</h3>
            <p>At the beginning of each course, trainees must receive an assessment plan that outlines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The units/modules to be assessed</li>
                <li>The methods of assessment to be used</li>
                <li>The timing of assessments</li>
                <li>The criteria for successful completion</li>
                <li>The appeals process</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>6.2 Feedback and Results</h3>
            <p>Trainees will receive feedback on their assessment performance within 10 working days of the assessment taking place. Feedback should be constructive, specific, and focused on how performance can be improved. Final results will be released after internal verification has been completed and any necessary moderation has taken place.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="appeals">
            <h2>7.0 Appeals Process</h2>
            <p>Trainees who wish to appeal an assessment decision must submit a formal appeal in writing to the Assessment Coordinator within 10 working days of receiving their results. The appeal must clearly state the grounds for appeal and provide supporting evidence where appropriate.</p>
            <p>Appeals will be considered by an Appeals Committee consisting of the Principal (or nominee), the Assessment Coordinator, and a trainer who was not involved in the original assessment. The Committee will review the assessment decision and all relevant evidence before making a determination. Trainees will be informed of the outcome of their appeal within 15 working days of its submission.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="review">
            <h2>8.0 Policy Review</h2>
            <p>This policy will be reviewed annually by the Assessment Committee to ensure it remains current, effective, and aligned with regulatory requirements. The review process will include consultation with stakeholders including trainers, assessors, and trainee representatives. Recommendations for changes to the policy will be presented to the Principal for approval.</p>
